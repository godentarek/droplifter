## Stories

### Dave accepts his miserable life

> Dave is bored at his local bar and drink prices are expensive. It's cold outside though, and he doesn't want to chance going someplace else and it turning out to be rubbish. He checks Droplifter for a laugh, and notices a drop attached to the wine bar just a few doors down - ‘it’s awesome here and not too crowded - having a great night'. Just as he is about to relocate, a new new drop pops up from someone saying they've waited half an hour in line outside the wine bar, and the bouncers aren’t letting people in wearing trainers. Dave sits back down and orders another overpriced beer.

### Amelia shares a moment

> Amelia is a nature lover who enjoys going for hikes in the valley. On one such evening walk, she sits herself down beside a tree for a well-earned rest break. She notices her phone has a surprisingly strong signal, and seeing a cheeky opportunity fires up Droplifter. After a quick photo, she drops a note at her spot to point out that at this time and at this location, the sun setting over the hills looks a bit like an arse. Future hikers will no doubt share in the delight of her discovery.

### Maurice makes friends

> Maurice is sitting at home on his couch. It's Saturday night, and he needs to make plans, stat. He pulls out his smartphone: no missed calls, no messages, no tinder matches. On a whim, he fires up Droplifter... and settles back into his couch, chatting with a number of nearby players. He chats up a frisky young lady (who is, in fact, his dad on the ipad upstairs). In an effort to track her down in real life, he sets out to the nearest burger joint to see if she’s there. Inevitably, she disappears off his chat list as he moves, but others appear and take her place on his list. He sits at Hungry Spot on chat for the rest of the night, talking to many more men he thinks are women.
